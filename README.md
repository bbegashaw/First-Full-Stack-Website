This was one of my first ever websites I created for a class project. It is a Chelsea Fan Page Website with some basic info about the team and a small form where visitors can "subscribe" to a news letter.
It has very, very basic HTML,CSS,Javascript and a bit of PHP. 
We used the XAMPP Web Server Package to make a full-stack website.

P.S. For some reason the form doesn't seem to work in here.
